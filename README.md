# Deep learning model for recognizing accents in speech

This is my attempt at building a model for finding the accents of french
speakers.

This model is adapted from whisper, the openai model for speech recognition.

## Use-case

The user reads some text. This is recorded as an audio file. This audio file is
then fed to the model which ouputs an accent: French, Belgian, Swiss.
