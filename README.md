# Deep learning model for grading speech

This is my attempt at building a model for grading non-native spanish speakers
based solely on their pronunciation.

## Use-case

The user reads some text. This is recorded as an audio file. This audio file is
then fed to the model which ouputs a grade: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, native.
